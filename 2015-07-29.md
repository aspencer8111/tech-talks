### Basic Vocab
[Person Class](https://gist.github.com/00bd624aaaf5b18a77c5)

1. **A variable** - a lowercase string or word used to store something in memory.

2. **Local Variable** - a variable with a local scope.
  * ```favorite_color = blue```

3. **Instance Variable** - a variable with an instance scope.
  * ```@favorite_color = blue # in an instance of class Person```
  * To access: ```alex = Person.new; alex.favorite_color```

4. **Class Variable** - a variable with a class scope.
  * ```@@favorite_color = blue # in the actual class Person```
  * To access: ```Person.favorite_color```

5. **Global Variable** - A variable with a global scope.
  * ```$RAILS_ENV```

**IMPORTANT** Variables can only hold data structures (strings, integers, booleans, etc.).

They can't natively hold code (Ex: ```code = 5.times puts "Boom Shaka Laka"``` won't fly.)

### Ruby Wats

1. **Undefined local variable...ruby's favorite error**
  * ```a``` *  # undefined local variable*
  * ```a == a``` * # nil*

2. **Undefined constant**
  * ```C``` * # undefined Constant*
  * ```C = C``` * # still an undefined Constant*


### Ruby Stuff Demystified

1. *(almost)* **Everything is a class**
  * Variables are not classes. But the stuff they hold is.
  * ```instance.class```
  * ```instance.class.superclass``` # continue up all the classes (wo modules)
  * ```instance.class.ancestors``` # includes modules and super classes
2. **Blocs, Procs, Lambdas**
  * **A block** is a chunk of code. Ex: A ```do``` ```end``` with code in between. Blocks CAN take arguments and use them in a court of law (or during execution.)
  * **A proc** is a way to save a block in a variable.
  * **A lambda** is a proc/block with a set number of attrs

3. **Methods & Yield**
  * Methods are named functions we usually use for object manipulation (vs blocks which we use for one off work).
  * Inserting ```yield``` into a method will allow a block to be passed in and called

### Ruby Awesomeness

1. ```&proc```
2. pry
  * View source
  * View method
  * binding.pry
  * gist this
  * clipit
